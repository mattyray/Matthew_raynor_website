      <p class="lead">I'm Matthew Raynor — a quadriplegic full-stack developer, artist, and writer who survived a catastrophic diving accident that left me paralyzed from the chest down.</p>
      <p>Before that day, I was a commercial fisherman working off the coast of Montauk, living wild and braving storms. A dive meant to ease tendonitis ended my mobility — but began my rebirth. I taught myself how to use a computer with two styluses and voice commands. From that place of near-total limitation, I rebuilt my life with code, creativity, and spiritual grit.</p>

      <h2 class="fw-bold">What I Do – Art, Writing & Press</h2>
      <p>I'm a multidisciplinary creator. My drone and landscape photography becomes fine art prints. My memoir, <em>Before Me After Me</em>, documents my physical and spiritual transformation. My work has been shown in local art shows and featured in the press — including <em>National Fisherman</em>, <em>The James Lane Post</em>, <em>The Southampton Press</em>, and more — not just for surviving, but for creating beauty in the aftermath.</p>

      <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">Photography & Art – Before and After</h2>
      <p>Before my accident, I took photos from fishing boats and during my travels — capturing wild seascapes and distant places. After I became paralyzed, I adapted through drone photography.</p>
      <p>Aerial shots gave me a way to keep creating — and a way to rise above. I've shown my work in pop-up art fairs and galleries across Long Island. Now, I offer custom drone photography and aluminum prints.</p>

      <h2 class="fw-bold">What I Build And Why You Need Me</h2>
      <p>I taught myself to code as a way to rebuild my life after a spinal cord injury left me paralyzed from the collarbone down. At first, I had lost my ability to create—and with it, my sense of purpose. So I invented a custom workflow that let me overcome my physical limitations and start programming.</p>
      
      <p>Now, I build modern, full-stack web apps using Django REST Framework, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. My recent work includes <strong>HistoryFace</strong>, an AI-powered image generator that fuses selfies with historical figures using facial recognition and machine learning, and a <strong>real-world logistics dashboard</strong> for an art moving company that handles scheduling, invoicing, and client management. I also maintain a live e-commerce site through my portfolio, MatthewRaynor.com.</p>
      
      <p>If you're looking for someone to take your idea from concept to deployment, I'm already in the chair—ready to ship.</p>

      <h2 class="fw-bold">What I Inspire – Motivational Work</h2>
      <p>My mission is to inspire others who are in dark places. I share raw reflections on disability, recovery, and faith through Substack, TikTok, and YouTube. I've hosted recovery meetings in a nursing home and write honestly about Buddhism, trauma, spiritual growth, and the power of discipline. I mix humor and heart to help others find their light — because I had to find mine the hard way, too.</p>

      <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5">How to Help</h2>
      <p>I'm working toward moving out of the nursing home and rebuilding my life in the community. Here's how you can support that journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Housing:</strong> I'm looking for an accessible apartment within 30 miles of Southampton, NY. The space must allow 24/7 caregiving and either be pre-adapted or open to reasonable modifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Care:</strong> I need daily help with physical care — especially someone trained or willing to be trained to assist with medication and hygiene, including suppository administration.</li>
        <li><strong>Fundraiser:</strong> My fundraiser helps cover moving costs, accessibility modifications, and essentials for independent living.</li>
      </ul>
